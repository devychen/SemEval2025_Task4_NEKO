### Abstract
The power and wide application of large language models (LLMs) has brought the concerns on its risk of leaking private or sensitive information. However, retraining the modules is expensive and impractical, which introduces machine unlearning - removing specific information from language models while preserving general utility. Task 4 at SemEval 2025 consists of a shared task with this exact objective. We present an approach which combines gradient ascent-based forgetting with Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based retention, applied to a 1-billion-parameter causal language model. Despite achieving effective forgetting, the system struggles with maintaining model utility. Our experiments reveal critical trade-off between unlearning effectiveness and performance preservation, highlighting challenges in practical machine unlearning implementations. 


### Methods
1. Perform Gradient Ascent on forgetting set <br>
Gradient Ascent: to maximize a function
- We negate the loss, changing the model's update direction to "increase loss".
- This effect makes the model "less proficient" at remembering the answers for these positions, as the increased loss indicates poorer performance in this area.
By continuously performing gradient ascent on this data, we can gradually reduce the model's reliance on this information, achieving an "unlearning" effect.

2. Perform Kullback-Leibler Divergence  <br>
The Kullback-Leibler Divergence score: quantifies how much one probability distribution differs from another probability distribution.
-  used to measure the prediction differences between the current model and the pre-trained model on normal samples, thereby ensuring that the model does not deviate from learning normal samples during the "unlearning" process.
